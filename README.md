This is a Django-based project management application designed to help users manage projects and tasks efficiently. The application provides a web interface to create, view, and manage projects and their associated tasks.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for managing projects and tasks
- Ability to create, update, and delete projects
- Ability to add detailed tasks under each project
- Task detail views for better task management
- Responsive design using CSS for better user experience


## Uses
- Manage multiple projects in one place

## How It Works

- Models define the data structure (projects and tasks)
- Views handle the business logic and data processing (currently minimal or to be implemented)
- Templates provide the HTML structure for the user interface
- Static files (CSS and JavaScript) enhance the look and interactivity of the application
- URL routing directs user requests to appropriate views
- Admin interface available for managing data through Django's built-in admin panel
